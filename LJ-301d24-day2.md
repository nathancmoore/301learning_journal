Today was another good day. I'm concerned about my portfolio long term. I'm sure I can do
the technical aspects of it, but I'm doubting my creativity. I'm gonna reach out
to some of my more artistic friends and loved ones for aesthetics inspiration.

I see the value of learning this material (or anything about coding) to my long-term
well-rounded growth as a programmer, but the truth is, I'm anxious to get into python
and start learning material that is gonna be useful to me directly on a daily basis.
Each day that I get closer to python, the more I just want the HTML/CSS/JS part of this to be over.

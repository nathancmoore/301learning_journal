Yesterday was a rough one. I feel like I'm barely keeping up with the
pair programming assignments, and the portfolio assignments are well by the wayside by now.
I'm not fulling digesting the material, only learning it well enough to complete the assignment.

I plan to spend a few hours this weekend catching up on the portfolio, and resubmitting what
I finish for all of this week's portfolio assignments.

The stress level is high.

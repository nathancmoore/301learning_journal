It's cool that heroku is available for free hosting on a very small scale. It will
give me an opportunity to share my smaller pet projects with my friends without having
to actually buy a domain name, though I suppose it probably would be worth investing
in a domain of my own at some point in the future. Gearing up for Project Week,
and I'm starting to feel pumped!
